## 🔹 Reusable Prompt Template

**Title:** Add a new Svelte widget/component to my static site

**Prompt:**

> I have a static website with the following setup:
>
> * `index.html` is my main page.
> * `_posts/` directory contains my blog posts as HTML files.
> * `site-links.html` is automatically generated by a Python script from `_posts/`.
> * I use a dark theme CSS stored in `assets/css/style.css`.
> * I have a Svelte widget directory: `svelte-widgets/`.
>
>   * Each component is a Svelte component (`.svelte`) in `svelte-widgets/src/`.
>   * The Svelte components are built into standalone JS modules in `assets/widgets/` using Vite.
> * The GitHub Actions workflow builds the Python-generated site-links and Svelte widgets, then deploys the site to the `gh-pages` branch.
>
> I want to add a new Svelte component to the site. The requirements are:
>
> 1. Describe the folder/file structure for the new component.
> 2. Explain how to mount it in the HTML file (`index.html` or any post HTML file).
> 3. Provide the necessary `<script>` include path.
> 4. Make sure it integrates with the existing dark theme and card grid layout.
> 5. Include any notes about styling, props, or interactivity.
>
> Give a **step-by-step guide** on how to create, build, and deploy this new Svelte component so it works seamlessly in the current static site setup.

* Copy-paste this prompt into ChatGPT (or another AI assistant) to get ready-to-use code + instructions.
* It guarantees that your new component will follow the **Option B setup** with `_posts/`, `index.html`, and `assets/widgets/`.
